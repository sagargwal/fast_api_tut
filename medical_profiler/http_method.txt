TYPES OF SOFTWARE

Static Software
Static software has very little or no interaction between the user and the software in terms of changing or managing data.
It mainly displays information.

Examples:
Clock
Calendar
Basic calculator

Dynamic Software
Dynamic software allows interaction between the user and the software.
The user can input data, and the software can process, store, modify, or delete that data.

Examples:
MS Excel
Google Docs
Banking software
E-commerce applications

CRUD OPERATIONS IN DYNAMIC SOFTWARE

Dynamic software usually performs four basic data operations called CRUD:

Create – Add new data
Retrieve – Read or fetch existing data
Update – Modify existing data
Delete – Remove data

CRUD is a data-handling concept and is most commonly used in dynamic software.

TYPES OF WEBSITES

Static Websites
Static websites show fixed content.
The same content is shown to every user.
There is no database or user-based interaction.

Examples:
Portfolio websites
Documentation pages

Dynamic Websites
Dynamic websites change their content based on user interaction.
They use backend logic and databases.

Examples:
Gmail
Amazon
Social media platforms

CLIENT–SERVER MODEL

Websites are not installed on the user’s system.
They are hosted on a server.

Client:
The client is the user interaction point.
Examples: web browser, mobile app, frontend UI.

Server:
The server contains the application logic and database.
It processes requests and sends responses back to the client.

HTTP PROTOCOL

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) defines the rules for communication between the client and the server.
It specifies how requests are sent and how responses are returned.

HTTP METHODS AND CRUD (CORRECTED)

CRUD operations are mapped to HTTP methods as follows:

Create – POST
Retrieve – GET
Update – PUT or PATCH
Delete – DELETE
